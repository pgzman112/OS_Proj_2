               PAGE TABLE SIMULATOR
               ====================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new `struct',
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef',
>> enumeration, or classes. Identify the purpose of each
>> in 25 words or less.

struct Page{
  long int V, P, F, U;
  string frameNum;
};
    This struct is used to represent a row of the page table, with V being the
    valid bit, P the permissions bit, F the frame number, and U the recently
    used bit.

---- FUNCTIONS ----

>> A2. List the function prototype and full documentation for each function
>> you have introduced to support Part A of the project.
>> Use the appropriate Google Style Guide for function documentation.

//Takes a hexadecimal string as input and returns its binary equivalent as a string
string hexToBin(string & hex);

//Takes a binary integer as input and returns its hexadecimal equivalent as a string
string binToHex(long int bin);

//Takes a decimal integer as input and returns its binary equivalent as a string
string decToBin(int dec);

//Takes a binary integer as input and returns its decimal equivalent as an integer
int binToDec(long int bin);

//Takes a hex or decimal input that represents a virtual address. This function
// does the full address translation process and implements the clock algorithm.
string addressChange(string & input, int idx, int offset, vector<Page> & PageTable, bool dec, bool clock, int & clockPointer);

Same as A1

---- FUNCTIONS ----

>> B2. List the function prototype and full documentation for each function
>> you have introduced to support Part A of the project.
>> Again, use the appropriate Google Style Guide for function documentation.

Same as A2

>> 1 1 2 0
>>
>> Translate the following sequence of address requests using the method

>> B4. Describe the data structure you used to search through the frames
>> following the clock roation, and how you might improve efficiency
>> if this was an implementation rather than a simulation.

Instead of a data structue, we used a single integer to keep track of the clock
rotation. We think this is very efficient considering its extremely low overhead.


>> B5. Did you need to handle any ambiguous scenarios or corner cases
>> for the Clock algorithm, left unspecified in the algorithm's description?
>> Explain any judgements you used in implementing unclear or

               SURVEY QUESTIONS
               ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

>> Any other comments?
